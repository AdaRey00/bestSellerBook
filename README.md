The goal of this project is to use the HTML DOM to create new HTML elements. I had 14 books (including their title, author, genre, language, first publishing year and the first book cover) and an almost empthy HTML page. I used vanilla Javascript to publish my book list on HTML. Below is the link to this webpage:
